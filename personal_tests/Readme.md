# Setup

1. Connect everything to the laptop (leader arm, follower arm, wrist camera)
2. Setup the selfie camera with the phone on the bench table and launch DroidCam on the Samsung GS25
3. Run `./start_virtualcam.sh` to steam the phone camera to the system so we can use it to capture data (this will block the current shell)
4. Do what you gotta do


# Teleoperate

After connecting the cameras and after running `./start_virtualcam.sh` run `./start_teleop.sh` to start the teleoperation.
